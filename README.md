# shameful

All Backbonejs code sits in views/js/main.js file. I use utils.js just for couple jquery functions. At the moment nodejs accepts form data directly and saves it in to the data.json file. I do not use Backbonejs models to save data and then provide data to the server. Code is not finished. For example Underscore.js template still sits in the same index.html file. I know I need to use Requirejs for that.
